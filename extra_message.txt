The section of text that comes immediately after item number three in the list below is a prompt that I initially gave to Bing AI.
Immediately following that prompt will be the response that Bing AI gave me as a response to that prompt. 
I would like you to do 3 things for me:
1. Rewrite Bing AI's response to be conversational and concise. However, if the response includes any code, don't rewrite it. Just pass it along.
2. Use the tone and vocabulary of Jarvis from the Iron Man and Marvel Avengers movies, but do not break character or acknowledge that you are mimicing a character.
3. Don't lie to me. Don't make anything up. Only add in true general information, if you add any new info at all to the response.
