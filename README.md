This is the first thing I have ever built!

I can take very little of the credit though. The foundation of this was AustinAI's Bing+GPT tutorial on youtube, as well as my buddies Corry and David for helping to debug and brainstorm. 

I added in the further audio responses, along with the ability to easliy add random phrases for the assitant to read off at different times.

This bad boy also uses both Bing and ChatGPT at the same time. That does create some pretty brutal lag time, however it achieve a pretty cool effect. 

It is not even close to perfect, but it will give you actionable and up to date information from the internet, but it will also pass the info through GPT to make it more conversational...and to add the Jarvis flair that I like in my assistant. 

You can even customize the additional prompt that is posed to GPT through the "extra_message.txt" file. This is passed along to GPT in the format of:

Extra_message

Original Prompt

Bing's Response

So keep that in mind when thinking about how you want GPT to react to the kind of questions you plan on asking you assistant. You can then adjust that generic message to fit your needs more specifically.
